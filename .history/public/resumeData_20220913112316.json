Being a part of this amazing community has been essential to my coding journey. I help students learn to code and help answer any questions within the community.  It’s exciting to watch upcoming developers hone their craft through my coaching.  I am looking for a position in Web Development that will utilize my react skills and help move your business forward.  I would love to meet you!   Please contact me at the phone number, email address below or fill out my contact form at the bottom  .",
